Like an onomatopoeia, it is what it sounds like.

I have been experimenting lately with functional programming, especially as it relates to the control of the flow of an interactive program. This script demonstrates some important concepts including the distribution of program attributes in function format, as well as the provision for the various functions' ability to choose to navigate an appropriate path according to current conditions. The subject matter chosen for this demonstration may be of little consequence, but the techniques necessary to make this program run are quite consequential to the development of a junior programmer.

This script was written using 64-bit R version 3.2.3 on a Windows 7 machine (and has been tested on macOS Sierra version 10.12.1). No special packages are required. To run, simply open the script in R, run all, and follow the prompts in the console.

Regarding the game itself, this game was inspired by the instructions provided by The United States Playing Card Company, although modifications have been made to fit this version (changes mainly relate to this being a single-player version). For complete instructions and more information, please visit www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/.

Also, please don't use this game for real gambling; I provide this script for demonstration purposes only. If you have a gambling problem, consider seeking assistance.
